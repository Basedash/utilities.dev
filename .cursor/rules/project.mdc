This project is called utilities.dev. It is a collection of small utilities built for developers to solve everyday problems like encoding strings or formatting code.

Each utility has its own page on a website that is completely dedicated to that one utility. There's also a homepage which has search functionality to find any utility on the website.

The project uses React with Next.js, Tailwind for styling, and shadcn/ui for components. If there's a shadcn component you want to use that is not yet in the project, you can install it like this:

`pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add button`

The project uses pnpm. Do not use plain npm commands.

You don't need to run `pnpm dev` after making changes. The user will be running the app locally for testing.

You should run `pnpm lint` after making changes and fix any outstanding issues.

# Utilities

Each utility is comprised of a few parts:
1. Utils used for all the logic
2. Unit tests for all the utils
3. The route's layout and page
4. A card on the home page

## Page design

Each utility page should have a title and subtitle describing the utility at a high level. It should use a card-based design for all of the major components. There should be an "About" section at the bottom which describes the utility, use cases, features, etc.
